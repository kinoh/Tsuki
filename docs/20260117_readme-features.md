# README Feature Refresh

## Overview
Updated the README feature list to reflect current capabilities and the planned move toward unified MCP integration.

## Problem Statement
The README emphasized per-user structured memory and a two-tier MCP split that no longer matches the intended direction.

## Solution
Replaced the per-user structured memory line with prompt-file memory, and expanded the feature list to cover router/sensory flow, sandboxing, and TTS.

## Design Decisions
- Prefer the stated roadmap (unified MCP integration) over legacy per-user framing.
- Keep the update limited to the feature list to avoid unrequested README rewrites.

## Implementation Details
- Edited the Features section in `README.md` to add TTS, sandbox, router/sensory, and prompt memory.
- Adjusted MCP integration wording to reflect the planned unified approach.

## Future Considerations
- Align the README with implementation changes once per-user MCP is removed in code.
