- Added a `UserContext` facade interface to expose only per-user state needed for response generation (thread lookup, memory load, toolsets, runtime context accessor).
- Added a `Responder` interface and `MastraResponder` implementation that own Mastra agent + usage storage while depending on the `UserContext` facade for per-user inputs.
- Updated `ActiveUser` to implement `UserContext` and delegate response generation (including scheduler notifications) to `MastraResponder`, keeping channel management/notification subscription in `ActiveUser` and agent invocation/usage logging inside the responder.
