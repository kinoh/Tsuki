## Decision: GUI local log storage and viewer

- The user prioritized recent logs for troubleshooting and requested no server upload.
- Local storage (localStorage ring buffer) was chosen for persistence.
- Logs are displayed in the GUI Status overlay with a clear action.
- Sensitive fields (token/authorization) are masked before storage.
