## Decision: GUI local log storage and viewer

- The user prioritized recent logs for troubleshooting and requested no server upload.
- Local storage (localStorage ring buffer) was chosen for persistence.
- Logs are displayed in the GUI Status overlay with a clear action.
- Log entries are rendered as block elements to allow spacing control per line.
- Log entries are color-coded by level for quicker scanning.
- Server metadata is logged at info level on connect instead of being rendered in the UI.
- Sensitive fields (token/authorization) are masked before storage.
