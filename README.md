a. Multi-tenant service: Unless explicitly authorized by Dify in writing, you may not use the Dify source code to operate a multi-tenant environment. 
    - Tenant Definition: Within the context of Dify, one tenant corresponds to one workspace. The workspace provides a separated area for each tenant's data and configurations.

    - Frontend Definition: For the purposes of this license, the "frontend" of Dify includes all components located in the `web/` directory when running Dify from the raw source code, or the "web" image when running Dify with Docker.

Please contact business@dify.ai by email to inquire about licensing matters.

2. As a contributor, you should agree that:

a. The producer can adjust the open-source agreement to be more strict or relaxed as deemed necessary.
